**Premise:
**Tagline: No one ever said Promotions were this hard.
**Que: Player running from cars and people and dogs chasing player with requests for side quests.
**Narration:
Once upon an idiot, there was an office drone that clawed his way up the ladder to get a Promotion, and at that instant something broke, he recalls an event in university of a curse placed upon him "Since you refuse to help anyone, lay it upon your head, if you ever reach for the stars, you will get more than you never wanted"...
**Storm sounds Cackles

**Game Play: On top of AI chasing player, any walk into the near space of an NPC will trigger their chat. Chat has timed responses. Auto attaching side quests
**Goal: To get home and go to sleep (edited)
